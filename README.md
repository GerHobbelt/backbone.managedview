# backbone.managedview

It is an extension for Backbone.View, which adds views management logic and structure.

## Properties and Methods

### manage

When set to `true`, view rendering and removing will be managed. Set to `false` if you need the default behavior of Backbone.View.

### insert

For top level view, insert should be defined as a function.

```coffee
insert: =>
  $("body").append @el
```

For item view, insert should be defined as a string â€” `"append"` or `"prepend`. If not set by default the value will be set to `"append"`.

```coffee
insert: "prepend"
```

### views

`views` is a hash that keep track of subviews. The key is the name of the view or a selector where the view will inserted to the DOM. The value is the subview object itself.

```coffee
views:
  "header.main": new App.Views.Components.MainHeader
  "footer.main": new App.Views.Components.MainFooter
```

The `views` hash value can also be an array. This can be used when constructing list type view.

```coffee
listsView = new App.Views.Components.Lists
listsView.views["#lists"] = []
@lists.each (list) =>
  listsView.views["#lists"].push new App.Views.Components.List
    model: list
```

### beforeRender

Define this function and it will be called the first during rendering process before DOM insertion and template execution.

### afterRender

Define this function and it will be called after DOM insertion, template execution, and subviews rendering.

### beforeRemove

Define this function and it will be called the first during removing process.

### afterRemove

Define this function and it will be called after all subviews have been removed.
